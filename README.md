#Snake AI - Purdue SIGAI
This is Purdue SIGAI's implementation of a Snake AI. This is our Fall 2015 project.

##To get this onto your computer
```
cd sigai
git clone https://github.com/PurdueSIGAI/Snake.git
cd Snake/js
```

##Current Errors
Currently only works on certain sizes of grids. If you're having trouble running the master version at a lab computer, open it in chrome and have it fill up half the screen. If you want the debugger open, have he widnow take up the full screen, with the dubugger taking up half and the snake grid on the other half.

##TODO
###AI
1. Get stacking function working properly
2. Continue work on deciding whether to stack or astar

###Engine
1. Remove key listeners
2. Make snake blocks surrounded by black, not blue
3. Get restart to work
4. Handle death better
